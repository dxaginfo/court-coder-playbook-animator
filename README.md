# Court Coder - Basketball Playbook Animator

Court Coder is an AI-powered web application that enables basketball coaches at all levels to easily create, animate, and share basketball plays with their teams.

## üèÄ Overview

Creating basketball playbooks has traditionally been a manual and time-consuming process. Court Coder streamlines this workflow by combining an intuitive drag-and-drop interface with generative AI to help coaches:

1. Quickly diagram plays with realistic player and ball movement
2. Generate natural animations from simple diagrams and text descriptions
3. Create shareable playbooks for team distribution
4. Save time and communicate plays more effectively
